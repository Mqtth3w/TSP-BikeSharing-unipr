# TPS with capacity in BikeSharing Relocation

## Problem description

A company that manages bike-sharing has the problem of relocating bikes every evening in the stalls where there is the greatest demand. In practice there are N stalls, each stall i has a certain number Ci of bikes parked in it in the evening and wants si parked in the same one in the morning.

The problem to be solved consists in trying to plan the operations of relocating the bikes in a minimum time. Formulate a mathematical model of this problem, translate it into AMPL and solve and comment on a particular instance of the problem.
